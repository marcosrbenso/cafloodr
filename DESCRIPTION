Description: 
    Provides tools for preprocessing Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and 
    running the 2D cellular automata flood model CADDIES/CAFlood 
    (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.07.409>) directly from R. 
    Functions include DEM conditioning, rainfall and inflow setup, 
    control point generation, and automated model execution. 
    Designed for flood modeling and hydrodynamic simulation at the catchment scale.
