\arguments{
\item{param}{List. A list of model parameters, typically including calibration and simulation settings (e.g., `time_start`, `time_end`, `max_DT`, `roughness_global`, etc.).}

\item{caflood_path}{Character. Full path to the CAFlood executable or script to be run.}

\item{Input}{Character. Directory path containing input data files required for the simulation (e.g., DEM, rainfall, etc.).}

\item{Output}{Character. Directory where simulation output will be saved.}

\item{event_name}{Character. Name or ID of the rainfall/flood event being simulated; used for labeling outputs.}

\item{dem_name}{Character. Filename (without extension) of the DEM to be used, assumed to be in the `Input` directory.}

\item{path2}{Character. Working directory path where temporary or auxiliary files may be stored or processed.}

\item{outlet_path}{Character. File path to a shapefile containing outlet or control points. Defaults to a specific SÃ£o Paulo shapefile.}

\item{rain_path}{Character. File path to the rainfall input data (e.g., CSV or TXT format).}

\item{stream_network}{Character. File path to the stream network shapefile or raster used to delineate flow directions and connectivity.}

\item{snap_dist}{Numeric. Maximum distance (in meters) for snapping outlet points to the stream network.}
}
\value{
This function is typically run for its side effects. It writes simulation results to the `Output` directory and may return logs, paths, or a summary object if implemented.
}
\description{
Executes the CAFlood model with specified parameters and input datasets for hydrodynamic flood modeling.
}
\details{
This function prepares and runs the CAFlood model by integrating elevation data (DEM), rainfall time series, and river network structures. It also manages outlet snapping and may perform pre-processing for flow direction and accumulation.
The simulation results typically include water depth maps, hydrographs at outlet points, and diagnostics files.
