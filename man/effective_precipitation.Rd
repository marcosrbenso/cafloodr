\title{Calculate Effective Precipitation Using the SCS Curve Number Method}
\usage{
effective_precipitation(P, CN, lambda, SS = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{Numeric vector or scalar. Total precipitation (mm).}

\item{CN}{Numeric vector or scalar. Curve Number, a parameter representing land use, soil type, and antecedent moisture condition (typically between 30 and 100).}

\item{lambda}{Numeric scalar. Initial abstraction coefficient (typically 0.2 as per standard SCS method).}

\item{SS}{Numeric scalar or vector. Optional. Pre-existing soil storage (mm), default is 0.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or scalar representing effective precipitation (mm).
}
\description{
Computes effective precipitation (also known as runoff) from total precipitation using
the USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number method.
}
\details{
The SCS Curve Number method estimates the amount of runoff generated from a rainfall event.
The potential maximum retention (S) is calculated from the Curve Number:
\deqn{S = (25400 / CN) - 254}
The initial abstraction (Ia), representing losses before runoff begins (e.g., infiltration, interception), is:
\deqn{Ia = \lambda \cdot S}
If \eqn{P > Ia}, the effective precipitation (Q) is calculated as:
\deqn{Q = \frac{(P - Ia)^2}{(P - Ia + S)}}
Otherwise, runoff is 0.
}
\examples{
effective_precipitation(P = 50, CN = 75, lambda = 0.2)
effective_precipitation(P = c(10, 30, 60), CN = 85, lambda = 0.05)
