\title{Create and Snap Control Points to Stream Network}
\usage{
make_control_points(
  Input,
  Lon,
  Lat,
  id,
  dem,
  dem_name,
  Event_name,
  period,
  stream_network,
  snap_dist
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Input}{Character. Directory path where the output control point shapefile will be saved.}

\item{Lon}{Numeric vector. Longitudes of the control points.}

\item{Lat}{Numeric vector. Latitudes of the control points.}

\item{id}{Character or numeric vector. Unique identifiers for each control point.}

\item{dem}{SpatRaster or RasterLayer. Digital Elevation Model used for elevation sampling and snapping logic.}

\item{dem_name}{Character. Name to be used in the output shapefile, typically associated with the DEM used.}

\item{Event_name}{Character. Name of the hydrological event or simulation, used for naming or metadata.}

\item{period}{Character or numeric. The simulation period or time interval associated with the event.}

\item{stream_network}{Spatial object (e.g., `sf` or `SpatVector`). Stream network used for snapping the control points.}

\item{snap_dist}{Numeric. Maximum distance (in meters) for snapping control points to the stream network.}
}
\value{
Saves a shapefile of the snapped control points to the specified `Input` directory. May also return a spatial object with snapped points if implemented.
}
\description{
Generates a shapefile of control (outlet) points based on longitude and latitude inputs, optionally snapping them to the nearest location on a stream network within a defined distance.
}
\details{
This function is commonly used to define outlet or monitoring points for hydrological modeling. It ensures that the provided coordinates are aligned with the stream network by snapping them within a buffer distance defined by `snap_dist`. The resulting control points are compatible with CAFlood and other similar flood routing models.
