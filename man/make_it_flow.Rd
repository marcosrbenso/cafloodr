\title{Create Inflow Time Series for CAFlood}
\usage{
make_it_flow(Input, Event_name, timesteps, water_level, tlx, tly)
}
\arguments{
\item{Input}{Character. Path to the input directory where the output inflow file will be saved.}

\item{Event_name}{Character. Name or identifier of the hydrological event, used for naming the output file.}

\item{timesteps}{Numeric vector. Sequence of time steps (e.g., in seconds) for which water level data is available.}

\item{water_level}{Numeric vector or matrix. Water level values (in meters) corresponding to each timestep. Should be the same length as `timesteps`, or a matrix with rows equal to `length(timesteps)` if multiple points.}

\item{tlx}{Numeric. X (longitude or easting) coordinate of the inflow point.}

\item{tly}{Numeric. Y (latitude or northing) coordinate of the inflow point.}
}
\value{
Writes an inflow configuration file (usually `.txt`) into the specified `Input` directory. This file is used by the CAFlood model to simulate inflows at specific locations.
}
\description{
Generates the inflow configuration for the CAFlood model based on water level time series and location coordinates. The output is typically saved in the model's input folder.
}
\details{
This function formats and saves a structured time series file required by CAFlood to simulate inflows at specific grid cells or coordinates. The inflow location is determined by the `tlx` and `tly` coordinates, and the flow magnitude is derived from the `water_level` time series.
The file is typically named based on the `Event_name` and includes headers required by CAFlood.
