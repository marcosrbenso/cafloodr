\title{Create Rainfall Time Series File for CAFlood}
\usage{
make_it_rain(Input, Event_name, timesteps, rainfall)
}
\arguments{
\item{Input}{Character. Directory where the rainfall file will be saved.}

\item{Event_name}{Character. Name or identifier of the rainfall event, used to name the output file.}

\item{timesteps}{Numeric vector. Time steps in seconds, representing the duration of each rainfall measurement interval.}

\item{rainfall}{Numeric vector. Rainfall intensity values (in mm/hr) corresponding to each timestep.}
}
\value{
Saves a formatted rainfall text file in the specified `Input` directory. This file can be used directly by the CAFlood model.
}
\description{
Generates a rainfall input file formatted for use with the CAFlood hydrodynamic model. The file includes rainfall intensity values over specified time steps and is saved to the input directory.
}
\details{
The rainfall file produced by this function is formatted according to CAFloodâ€™s expected input structure. Each row typically includes a time and corresponding rainfall intensity value. The rainfall data must align with the model's timestep configuration.
Ensure that `timesteps` and `rainfall` are of equal length, and that rainfall values are consistent with the desired temporal resolution.

  Input = "C:/Projects/Input",
  Event_name = "rain_event_2021",
  timesteps = seq(0, 3600, by = 300),
  rainfall = c(0, 10, 15, 5, 0)
