\title{Run the CAFlood Model}
\usage{
make_it_run(caflood_path, Input, Output, controller)
}
\arguments{
\item{caflood_path}{Character. Full file path to the CAFlood executable (e.g., `"C:/Models/CAFlood/caflood.exe"`).}

\item{Input}{Character. Path to the input folder containing model setup files (e.g., DEM, rainfall, control points, etc.).}

\item{Output}{Character. Path to the output folder where simulation results will be stored.}

\item{controller}{Character. Path to the control file (e.g., `.txt`) that contains simulation settings and file references.}
}
\value{
This function runs for its side effects and does not return a value. It executes the CAFlood model, generating outputs in the specified `Output` directory. If implemented, it may log progress or return execution status.
}
\description{
Executes the CAFlood hydrodynamic flood model using a specified controller file, input directory, and output directory.
}
\details{
The `make_it_run()` function is a simple wrapper to call the CAFlood executable via system command. The controller file should include all necessary parameters and file paths for the simulation.
Ensure that all required input files (DEM, rainfall, control points, etc.) are correctly referenced in the controller file and exist in the `Input` directory.
